In this project we take photos using a telescope of the globular cluster NGC3201, resulting in images of different light bands (infrared, visible, blue), yielding results through data analysis of the age and distance of NGC 3201. This allows to find what the luminosity and mass distribution of stars in not just NGC 3201, but other celestial objects such as galaxies and open clusters. Further research of this object suggested interesting properties, such as its initial orgin and the type of celestial objects present.

# Project Overview  <a name="overview-main"></a>

### Context <a name="overview-context"></a>

NGC 3201 is a *globular cluster* located in the southern constellation of Vela, outside of the Milky Way galaxy. It was first discovered by Scottish astronomer *James Dunlop* on May 18, 1826, which was then listed in his 1827 catalogue. 

Globular clusters are a loose collection of stars bound together by gravity, with a majority of the stars located in its center. They normally form from *giant molecular clouds of gas*, which we can infer that NGC 3201 was formed at around the same time as the Galaxy (Milky Way).

We investigated this object with a Celestron C11 telescope, collecting data in different light (I, V and R) bands. From these observations, we generated HR (Hertz-sprung Russel) diagrams, which shows the relationship of the stars in this cluster. Applying an *isochrone fit* allows us to determine the age and distance to this cluster from our Sun. 

Processing isochrone fits yields results of an age estimated to be roughly 12.0 +/- 0.5 Gyr (1 Gyr = 1 billion years), and the estimated distance was around 5.5 +/- 0.3 kpc (1 kpc = 1000 pc).

Based on our results, we were then able to find a *stellar mass distribution* of NGC 3201, by first finding the *absolute magnitude* and the *luminosity* following that. The absolute magnitude is often defined as the brightness (magnitude) of a *celestial object* as seen from a distance of 10 parsecs (pc). Luminosity is the amount of *radiated light energy* over time.

### Actions <a name="overview-actions"></a>

To measure the properties of NGC 3201, we firstly obtained V, R and I band images (Visible, Red and Infrared) with the C11 telescope. This telescope uses technology called *CCD detectors*, essentially converting incoming photons into electrons, resulting in a *FITS image file*. 

We used many FITS image files in our data processing. A combination of *bias exposures* (zero second images) and one hour dark exposures were used to remove noise and *hot pixels* from the detector, allowing for a clearer image.

*Flatfield exposures* were also used when it was dusk, allowing for a uniform distribution of light across the sky. Using all of these different images, these were subtracted from the images obtained with the telescope of NGC 3201 to obtain *science images*, allowing for analysis to begin. 

Methods of *calibration* and *photometry* were used to obtain final results for the distance and age of NGC 3201

<br>

Based upon this, we were able to obtain a *histogram* of the estimated counts for each band of NGC 3201, which is shown below.

### Results <a name="overview-results"></a>

#### NGC 3201 science image

Our final science image in the R-band is shown below, and was a result of data processing FITS images, ensuring noise and hot pixels were accounted for. 

<br>

<br>

The main reason for choosing this band was due to *star density*, i.e. there were a lot more star observations in the red-band than the others. This is important for our observations, as we want to maximise our data set and outline any patterns for our final analysis. The image clarity in this image was also highest, and the stars were more pronounced.

<br>

#### Determining distance

For us to find the distance to NGC 3201, we used a distance relationship between *absolute* and *apparent* magnitudes. This was done with Isochrone fits for the approximate ages of the cluster, yielding us the age of the cluster in reference to the literature value.

<br>
![alt text](/img/posts/isochrone_fig.png "Isochrone Fit and HR diagram for NGC 3201")

<br>

This was determined by using formulae that are functions of colour bands, such as V-R and V-I. The distance can be found from the *offset difference* in the HR diagrams and isochrone fits, which gives us the *distance modulus*. The distance modulus can be used to determine the distance, which was determined to be: d = 5.5 +/- 0.3 kpc. Accepted literature values for this distance are 4.9 +/- 0.11 kpc (from Palau and Jordi Miralda-Escude, 2021) and 5.0 +/- 0.4 kpc (Kremer et al., 2018). Our distance determined seems to agree with the literature values, within 2 standard errors of the uncertainty.

<br>

#### Age

The best estimate for the age of NGC 3201 was determined from the *average age* of isochrone fits, where the uncertainty is assumed to be the spread of these ages. We obtained an age of 12.0 +/- 0.5 Gyr, which compared to the literature age of 12.2 +/- 0.5 Gyr (Monty et al., 2018), seems to overlap within 1 standard error.

<br>

#### Mass-luminosity

We obtained mass estimates for NGC 3201 by using magnitude lists, alongside our estimated distance to find the *absolute magnitude* of NGC 3201 in each band (V, R, I). The *magnitude to luminosity converstion* is then used, to convert absolute magnitude to luminosities. Finally, the mass-luminosity relationship was applied to convert luminosities into masses, resulting in a plot of the stallar mass distribution shown below.

![alt text](/img/posts/mass_dist.png "Stellar Mass Distribution in NGC 3201")

<br>

The statistics for each band shown above can be seen in the below table, where each mass is in *solar masses* and each value is rounded to 2 decimal places.

<br>

| **Band** | **Mean mass** | **Median mass** | **Standard deviation** | **Minimum mass** | **Maximum mass** |
|---|---|---| ---| ---| ---|
| I-band | 1.71 | 1.55 | 0.72 | 0.39 | 7.12 |
| V-band | 1.37 | 1.28 | 0.49 | 0.19 | 4.53 |
| R-band | 1.65 | 1.50 | 0.59 | 0.57 | 5.76 |

<br>

It appears that the mean, median, maximum and minimum mass differs by at least 1 solar mass for each band. This could be due to larger stars peaking in the I-band, but it is more likely that hotter stars were instead included for our analysis, since the centre part of NGC 3201 is likely to include many older stars (Kravtsov et al., 2010). There is a possible *binary star system* that has been detected, given our large maximum mass. It would be hard however to determine definitively whether or not the star or stars are of a binary system, given our choice of observations.

# Extension <a name="extension-title"></a>

### Better methods for determining results <a name="extension-methods"></a>

While the distance obtained here, which was 5.5 +/- 0.3 kpc, does overlap with literature values, there are alternative better methods from literature that can be used instead. NGC 3201 is known to have 160 RR Lyraes. RR Lyraes are *variable stars* that vary in luminosity, which are known to be *great standard candles*. They have a known absolute magnitude, allowing for a more accurate measurement of the distance to the star and NGC 3201 as well.

Uncertainties can also be reduced with the RR Lyrae star method. Isochrone fitting is a powerful tool, but it requires more assumptions and is dependent on model parameters. RR Lyrae stars on the other hand, allow for a direct and empircal approach for this measurement.

Moreover, rather than just using photometry, we can use *photometric* and *spectroscopic* observations to determine the distance. Different isochrone models can also be used for a more accurate age, such as *Dartmouth* isochrones rather than *Giradi* isochrones.

<br>

### Origin of NGC 3201 <a name="extension-origin"></a>

NGC 3201 has numerous properties that sugget it has an origin outside of the Milky Way Galaxy. There is evidence for *retrograde motion*, and values for a radial velocity moving away from the Galaxy, implying it originated outside. The ages of the Milky Way and NGC 3201 are also similar; 12.0 +/- 9,5 Gyr and 13.6 +/- 0.8 Gyr respectively, suggesting they formed at approximately the same time.

<br>

### Tidal stream generation by NGC 3201 <a name="extension-tidalstream"></a>

NGC 3201 contains a tidal stream that is a result of the Milky Way's tidal forces acting on this globular cluster. Due to these significant tidal forces, there is a large amount of mass loss from NGC 3201, between 0.3 to 2.1e+7 Solar masses, over the last 5 Gyr. This is comparble to a value between 7 - 55% of the current mass of NGC 3201, and it is believed that a majority of this mass is moving inwards towards the Milky Way. This tidal stream also contains stars originating from NGC 3201.
